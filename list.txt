关于婚姻
The other thing about marriage,
还有一件事非常值得大家知道
this is really worth knowing too is that
我是从荣格的书里学来的
I've learned this in part from reading Jung.
结婚的时候你会怎么做？
What do you do when you get married?
很简单
That's easy.
你找一个和你一样无用又可怕的人
You take someone who's just as useless and horrible as you are
然后你把自己和他们绑定在一起
and then you shackle yourself to them.
然后你会说
And then you say,
“无论发生了什么，我们都不会逃离彼此”
"We're not running away no matter what happens."
嗯，看着挺不错吧
Yeah, well, that's perfect,
因为你根本就逃不掉
because then you don't get to run away.
是这样的，如果你能够逃离
And the thing is like if you can run away,
你就没办法跟彼此说实话了
you can't tell each other the truth,
因为一旦你跟别人说了真实的你
because if you tell someone the truth about you
而他们又没有逃离
and they don't run away,
他们其实根本就没听你说啥
they weren't listening.
所以如果你身边没有无法逃离的人
And so if you don't have someone around that can't run away
那你就没人可以说实话
then you can't tell them the truth.
这也是婚姻的部分意义所在
And so that's part of the purpose of the marriage.
于是就这样吧
It's like, okay, okay,
我赌你，你赌我
I'll bet on you, you bet on me,
虽然明明都知道是个会输的赌注
it's a losing bet, we both know that.
但鉴于目前的情况
But given our current circumstances,
我们又找不到更好的人了
we're unlikely to find anyone better,
这一点是可以确信的
that's for sure.
对吧
You know.
所以我们可以从中得到两点
There are two things that come off of that.
第一
One is,
人们都在等自己的真命天子/天女出现
you know people are waiting around to find Mr. or Mrs. Right.
但朋友们，踏踏实实
It's like here's something to think about, man,
仔细想一想
to put yourself on your feet right.
如果你去了一个派对，找到了真命天子/天女
If you went to a party and you found Mr. Right,
他/她看着你却没有尖叫着跑掉
and he looked at you and didn't run away screaming,
那说明他/她根本就不是你的真命天子/天女
that would indicate that he wasn't Mr. Right at all.
对吧？就像尼采讲的那个笑话一样
Right? It's like the old Nietzschean joke,
“如果有人喜欢你，你会立刻对他们丧失兴趣”
"If someone loves you that should immediately disenchant you with them."
对吧，或者伍迪·艾伦说过的笑话
Right, right. Or it's the Woody Allen joke,
“我从来都不属于任何一个把我当做会员的俱乐部”
"I never belong to a club that would take me as a member."
这就有意思了…很值得思考
So that's an interesting… that's a very interesting thing to think about.
所以，你把自己
And so, you're going to 
同一个和你一样不完美的人绑在一起
shackle yourself to someone who's just as imperfect as you are.
但问题是
And then the issue is, you… you…
你可能到了一个你能够真正协商事情的情境中
you might be in a situation where you can actually negotiate,
因为你可能会觉得
because you might think,
好吧，你有些事做的不够好
Well, there's some things about you that aren't going so right,
我有些事做的不够好
and there's some things about me that aren't going so right,
之后50年里，我们就困在了彼此都不够好的后果之中
and we're bloody well stuck with the consequences for the next 50 years,
我们可以一起解决这个问题
so we could… we could either straighten this out
或者一起痛苦的度过之后的50年
or we can suffer through it for the next five decades.
你们知道人都是这样的
And you know people are of the sort that
不到万不得已的地步
without that degree of seriousness,
是不会去解决问题的
those problems will not be solved.
反正总是有退路
You'll leave things unnamed
就不会去正视问题
because there's always an out.
和别人同居其实也是这样的
It's the same thing when you're living together with someone.
你知道吗，那些婚前同居的人
You know that people who live together
更容易离婚
before they're married are more likely to get divorced,
而不是更不容易离婚
not less likely.
原因在于
And the reason for that is
当你们同居的时候
what exactly are you saying to one another
你们真实的想法是什么
when you live with each other.
仔细想想
Just think about it.
“好吧
"Well,
就目前来说
for now,
你是我能骗来的最好的人选了
you're better than anything else I can trick
但我想保留随时能够替换掉你
but I'd like to reserve the right to trade you in
的权利
conveniently.
万一有更好的人看上了我呢”
If someone better happens to stumble into me."
如果有人是这么做的，换谁都会觉得自己受到了侮辱吧
Well, how could someone not be insulted to their core by an offer like that.
人们之所以会配合
Now they're willing to play along with it
因为他们也会这样对你
because they're going to do the same thing with you.
事情确实就是这样的
Well, that's exactly it.
就好像是，嗯，没错
It's like, yeah, yeah,
我知道你不会给我承诺
I know you're not going to commit to me
这意味着你并不重视我的价值
so that means you don't value me
也没有把我们的感情置于其他事情之上
or our relationship above everything else.
但只要我需要逃离的时候就能逃离
But as long as I get to escape if I need to,
我就愿意参与这场游戏
then I'm willing to put up with that.
意图就是这样
It's like, that's a hell of a say.
你可能会觉得，把自己和其他人绑在一起很蠢
You might think how stupid is it to shackle yourself to someone.
确实很蠢，朋友们
It's like, it's stupid, man,
这个没啥疑问
there's no doubt about that.
但和其他的选择相比
But compared to the alternatives,
这其实是非常好的选择了
it's pretty damn good,
因为如果没有绑定在一起的话
because without that shackling,
有些事情你永远都学不会
there are things you will never ever learn,
因为你会逃避这些事情
because you'll avoid them.
你总是选择逃避
You can always leave.
但如果你能够逃避
And if you can leave,
那你就不用跟彼此坦诚了
then you don't have to tell each other the truth.
就是这么简单
It's as simple as that,
因为你可以逃避
because you can just leave,
你也没有人可以吐露真实的自己了
and then you don't have anyone you can tell the truth to.
